# Reflection App

> **An anonymous emotional reflection platform** where users answer thought-provoking questions, see how others feel, and explore emotional awareness — all without personal data or direct messaging.

---

## 📌 Overview
Reflection App is a cross-platform (web + mobile) application designed to help users express their thoughts and feelings anonymously. The app presents AI-generated and curated questions, stores responses securely, and displays them on a public wall for shared insight.

This project is actively being developed and is a collaboration with the original idea creators.
